# AREU Status - GNOME Extension
A GNOME extension that displays the number of ambulances out in the province of Milan, Italy.
It uses the data available at the [official website](https://www.areu.lombardia.it/web/home/missioni-aat-real-time) of AREU, the agency that coordinates the ambulances in Lombardy, Italy.

Please note that the number only refers to ambulances in the **Province of Milan**. You can change the province by changing the constant called `AAT` in [extension.js](https://github.com/r-carissimi/areu-status-gnome/blob/main/extension.js).

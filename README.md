# AREU Status - GNOME Extension
A GNOME extension that displays the number of ambulances out in Lombardy, Italy.
It uses the data available at the [official website](https://www.areu.lombardia.it/web/home/missioni-aat-real-time) of AREU, the agency that coordinates the ambulances in Lombardy, Italy.

Please note that <u>by default</u> the number only refers to ambulances in the **Province of Milan**. You can change the province in extension settings (use the "extensions" app and click on the gear icon, if provided by your distro).
